# Using the Perceptron Algorithm for Machine Learning

A perceptron algorithm generates outputs or decisions based on the product of input features and optimal weight coefficients. In this project, I implemented a custom perceptron algorithm to classify flowers, given their sepal and petal lengths. I used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) to train the perceptron.

To easily browse through the project notebook, use either
  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shambhavithakur/machine-learning-with-perceptron) or [NbViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shambhavithakur/machine-learning-with-perceptron/blob/master/machine-learning-with-perceptron.ipynb).
