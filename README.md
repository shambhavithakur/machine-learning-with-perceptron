# Using the Perceptron Algorithm for Machine Learning

A perceptron algorithm generates outputs or decisions based on the product of input features and optimal weight coefficients. In this project, I implemented a custom perceptron algorithm to classify flowers, given their sepal and petal lengths. I used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) to train the perceptron.
